            <p>I am an alum of FRC 2122 Team Tators. While I mainly focused on the Mechanical aspects of the team, from CAD to machining, I've also worked heavily with the public relations side of things, from editing videos to presenting to sponsors. I'm studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Idaho and still work in <i>FIRST</i> programs with both the PNW district and the Idaho Regional Planning Committee</p>

            <p>I'm one of the members of the Student Leadership Council for FRC Team 3132, Thunder Down Under. I've participated in <i>FIRST</i> since 2014, and started FRC in 2015, while being active in volunteering/participation at Australian <i>FIRST</i> events. I have been part of the mechanical subteam for 3 years and also am heavily involved with our business/outreach/media subteam. At competitions, I am part of the pit crew, and also talk to judges. I am currently leading on outreach projects with teams around the world, which I hope would improve the <i>FIRST</i> experience of all teams. Iâ€™m only a sophomore and have no clue what I would like to do in the future yet, only that I love STEM. I love music and learning new instruments, reading, meeting people, sports, and basically have no life outside of robotics.</p>

            <p>I'm Harrison, a High School Senior and an alumni of Team 1296, Rockwall Robotics. While on the team I did a little bit of everything, from leading up the business, cad, and manufacturing teams to helping with match/regional strategy and serving as human player (#chutedoor). I enjoy CAD (Solidworks > Inventor) and helping younger students find a passion for STEM. Other hobbies include an unhealthy amount of reading about finance and cryptocurrencies. I look forward to an unhealthy amount of stress while finding the right school to study mechanical engineering and some degree of finance/economics. </p>

            <p>I am an alumnus of the Iron Patriots (4131) from Renton Washington. My team elected me president my junior year, and Chief of Software as a freshman, sophomore, and senior, so I have majorly contributed to a total of five robots' code (including an off-season T-shirt launcher). I'm a freshman at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I plan to major in computer science and continue to learn everything I can about programming. I'll also maintain my menagerie of projects, including Excalibot, a vector/matrix calculator, and the <i>FIRST</i> Discord management bot Dozer. I also practice archery intermittently and plan to learn some pen-and-paper games in the next year.</p>

I'm an experienced programmer and am also heavily involved with awards, business, and outreach endeavours. Iâ€™ve devoted myself to trying to improve FRC and <i>FIRST</i> as a whole, and for that I was a Deanâ€™s List Finalist in 2017. Iâ€™m currently working on two new software projects for the <i>FIRST</i> community to use in the coming months that I hope a lot of people will enjoy. Iâ€™ll be staying in <i>FIRST</i> once I graduate this year and will be pursuing a Computer Science degree. In my spare time I enjoy writing, playing the piano, and writing software.</p>
