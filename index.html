            <p>I'm Harrison, a rising High School Senior and an alumni of Team 1296, Rockwall Robotics. While on the team I did a little bit of everything, from leading up the business, cad, and manufacturing teams to helping with match/regional strategy and serving as human player (#chutedoor). I enjoy CAD (Solidworks > Inventor) and helping younger students find a passion for STEM. Other hobbies include an unhealthy amount of reading about finance and cryptocurrencies. I look forward to an unhealthy amount of stress while finding the right school to study mechanical engineering and some degree of finance/economics. </p>

I am currently leading on outreach projects with teams around the world, which I hope would improve the <i>FIRST</i> experience of all teams. I’m only a sophomore and have no clue what I would like to do in the future yet, only that I love STEM. I love music and learning new instruments, reading, meeting people, sports, and basically have no life outside of robotics.</p>
