            <p>I am an alum of FRC 2122 Team Tators. While I mainly focused on the Mechanical aspects of the team, from CAD to machining, I've also worked heavily with the public relations side of things, from editing videos to presenting to sponsors. I'm studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Idaho and still work in <i>FIRST</i> programs with both the PNW district and the Idaho Regional Planning Committee</p>

I've participated in <i>FIRST</i> since 2014, and started FRC in 2015, while being active in volunteering/participation at Australian <i>FIRST</i> events. I have been part of the mechanical subteam for 3 years and also am heavily involved with our business/outreach/media subteam. At competitions, I am part of the pit crew, and also talk to judges. I am currently leading on outreach projects with teams around the world, which I hope would improve the <i>FIRST</i> experience of all teams. Iâ€™m only a sophomore and have no clue what I would like to do in the future yet, only that I love STEM. I love music and learning new instruments, reading, meeting people, sports, and basically have no life outside of robotics.</p>

Iâ€™m currently working on two new software projects for the <i>FIRST</i> community to use in the coming months that I hope a lot of people will enjoy. Iâ€™ll be staying in <i>FIRST</i> once I graduate this year and will be pursuing a Computer Science degree. In my spare time I enjoy writing, playing the piano, and writing software.</p>

            <p>I am on FRC team 1902, Exploding Bacon. I have been around FIRST since 2013 when my older brother (Ryan) took interest. I joined FIRST/FLL in 2014 and 
              began to assist 1902 until 2016, when I became an official student. I will graduate in 2021 with 6 official student years and will continue to volunteer and hopefully mentor. 
              On 1902 I have held various officer, team lead, subteam/subsystem, drive team, and pit positions. I work with the machines, control systems, award writing, and more. (everything 
              except programming) I am dedicated to sharing FIRST and STEAM around the world while pursuing my passion to become a firefighter paramedic. I am currently a fire cadet where I 
              train to become a firefighter and compete in Firematics and Combat Challenges. In my spare time I enjoy various arts, music, writing, and volunteering.</p>

          <p>Iâ€™m an alumnus from Barker Redbacks, Team 4613 from Sydney, Australia. Iâ€™ve only been in FIRST since 2017, but in that time Iâ€™ve primarily done strategy with some mechanical on the side,
            as well as being on the drive team for the offseason. Since 2017, I have travelled over 19,000 miles to and from FIRST events, including the 2017 Championship in Houston, Texas. I graduated
            high school in 2018 and have been accepted to attend the University of New South Wales, studying aviation and flying. I hope to go on to become a commercial pilot. In the meantime, I volunteer
            at VEX and FTC events, as well as the upcoming FRC regionals in March/April.

My team elected me president my junior year, and Chief of Software as a freshman, sophomore, and senior, so I have majorly contributed to a total of five robots' code (including an off-season T-shirt launcher). I'm a sophomore at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I plan to major in computer science and continue to learn everything I can about programming. I'll also maintain my menagerie of projects, including Excalibot, a vector/matrix calculator, and the <i>FIRST</i> Discord management bot Dozer. I also practice archery intermittently and plan to learn some pen-and-paper games in the next year.</p>

        <h5>Staff | Team 1937 | Alumni | May 2018 - Present</h5>
        
        <p>FIRST info:
          I joined FIRST at 2018 to FRC team 1937 "Elysium".
          Since I was in 12th grade when I joined the team, it was my first and last year as a student. In that year I did my best, 
          putting much of my time in the mechanical crew, and helping a little in outreach, in addition to the role of the Safety Captain. 
          My team didn't get to the DCMP this season so that gave me an opportunity to try out volunteering. I had the amazing opportunity 
          to pack so much experience into such a short time. In addition, FIRST is where I found my place socially, I've found many friends 
          that are now some of my best friends.</p>
        <p><b>Favourite FIRST memory:</b>
          My first competition was the #1 District Event. I had to hit the ground running, but I found myself pretty fast and learned my role on the spot. 
          At that competition I made good friends, and I also met someone special. That first competition was the last thing I needed to make me completely 
          fall in love with FIRST.</p>
